/** An order represents a process initiated by a peer to bid (buy) or ask(sell) bitcoins in
  * the Coinffeine market.
  *
  * The peers of the Coinffeine network are there to exchange bitcoins and fiat money in a
  * decentralized way. When one peer wants to perform a buy or sell operation, he emits
  * an order. Objects of this class represent the state of an order.
  *
  * @param orderType  The type of order (bid or ask)
  * @param amount     The gross amount of bitcoins to bid or ask
  * @param price      The price per bitcoin
  * @param started    Whether the order has actually started
  * @param inMarket   Presence on the order book
  * @param cancelled  Whether the order was cancelled
  * @param exchanges  The exchanges that have been initiated to complete this order
