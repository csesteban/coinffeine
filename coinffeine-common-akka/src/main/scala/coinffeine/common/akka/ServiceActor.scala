    /** Starting point of the service actor.

      * This function defines the starting point of the service actor. Once a [[Start]] message
      * is received, the actor will use the [[Receive]] object resulting from this function to
      * process incoming messages. This [[Receive]] handler is meant to be overridden with an
      * implementation that performs the actions needed in order to start the service, i.e. tell
      * or ask to other actors (perhaps start some other services). Once start process has been
      * completed, the user code may invoke [[becomeStarted()]], which will fire a [[Started]]
      * message to the actor that requested the service to start, and then will set the
      * [[Receive]] object passed as argument as the new message handler.
      *
      * This is an example of how this function may be overridden to make the service interact
      * with some other actors in a starting phase.
      *
      * {{{
      *   override def starting(args: MyArgs) = {
      *     otherActor ! SomeMessage
      *     handle {
      *       case SomeResponse => someOtherActor ! SomeOtherMessage
      *       case SomeOtherMessage => becomeStarted(receivingMessages)
      *     }
      *   }
      * }}}
      *
      * We may use the starting function to perform synchronous initialization, as long as it
      * doesn't lock the calling thread too much time (remember: actors are meant to be
      * asynchronous), as the following example shows.
      *
      * {{{
      *   override def starting(args: MyArgs) = {
      *     initSomethingThatDoesNotTakeTooMuchTime();
      *     becomeStarted(receivingMessages)
      *   }
      * }}}
      *
      * Finally, we may provide a trivial implementation of the starting process if no
      * initialization is needed, as the following example shows.
      *
      * {{{
      *   override def starting(args: MyArgs) = { becomeStarted(receivingMessages) }
